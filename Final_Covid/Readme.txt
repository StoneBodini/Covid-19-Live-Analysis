Covid-19 Live analysis

Intro:
Upon running app.py this project will host a website locally on your machine for viewing.
Copy and paste the given IP to your desired web browswer to view the site. App.py will take
between 1-2 minutes to produce a local IP address because the dataset it grabs it generated
and cleaned live. 

Email Notification:
By selecting the subscription tab you are able to add your email to the database and receive
email updates. You can request for an update based on the county you input to the subscription
field.

Analysis:
The heat map analysis shows the most up to date covid-19 data in three categories. Total 
cases, cases per 100k people, and a risk analysis generated by us. We also display a 30 day
line graph that shows the trend of covid over the last month.
